    "# REWOO-ReAct Hybrid Pattern Implementation with Strands Multiagent Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates a **hybrid REWOO-ReAct pattern** using the Strands multiagent graph framework. It combines REWOO's structured planning approach with ReAct's direct tool execution, creating a two-stage system that balances planning reliability with execution efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of two specialized agents connected in a sequential graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query → [Planner] → [Solver] → Final Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Planner Agent (REWOO-style)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Generates structured execution plans without executing tools\n",
    "- **Input**: User query (e.g., \"Check my flight and change to earlier time\")\n",
    "- **Output**: Structured plan with numbered steps:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Plan 1: Retrieve flight information\n",
    "  #E1 = get_reservation_details[reservation_id=\"3442587242\"]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Plan 2: Search for earlier flights\n",
    "  #E2 = search_direct_flight[origin=origin_code, destination=dest_code, date=travel_date]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Plan 3: Update reservation with selected flight\n",
    "  #E3 = update_reservation_flights[reservation_id=\"3442587242\", cabin=cabin_class, flights=selected_flights, payment_id=payment_info]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Custom agent class using `generate_flight_plan` tool\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Solver Agent (ReAct-style)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Executes the plan using ReAct pattern with direct tool access\n",
    "- **Input**: Structured plan from planner + original user query\n",
    "- **Process**: \n",
    "  - Receives the plan as guidance for tool execution order\n",
    "  - Uses ReAct reasoning to execute tools with full access to airline tools\n",
    "  - Can adapt execution based on intermediate results\n",
    "  - Provides natural language responses\n",
    "- **Output**: Final user response with completed actions\n",
    "- **Implementation**: ReAct agent with `solve_flight_query` tool and full tool suite\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Approach Benefits\n",
    "- **Planning Reliability**: REWOO-style planner ensures systematic approach\n",
    "- **Execution Flexibility**: ReAct-style solver can adapt during execution\n",
    "- **Reduced Latency**: Only 2 agents vs 3 in pure REWOO\n",
    "- **Better Error Handling**: ReAct solver can recover from plan deviations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Agent Classes\n",
    "Due to multiagent graph requirements, each agent extends the base `Agent` class with custom `stream_async()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PlannerAgent(Agent):\n",
    "    async def stream_async(self, prompt: str):\n",
    "        plan_result = self.tool.generate_flight_plan(user_query=prompt)\n",
    "        message = Message(content=[{\"text\": str(plan_result)}])\n",
    "        agent_result = AgentResult(\n",
    "            stop_reason=\"end_turn\",\n",
    "            message=message,\n",
    "            metrics=EventLoopMetrics(),\n",
    "            state=None\n",
    "        )\n",
    "        yield {\"result\": agent_result}\n",
    "\n",
    "class SolverAgent(Agent):\n",
    "    async def stream_async(self, prompt: str):\n",
    "        parsed = extract_original_task_and_plan(prompt)\n",
    "        final_answer = self.tool.solve_flight_query(\n",
    "            user_query=parsed[\"original_task\"],\n",
    "            plan=parsed[\"plan_text\"]\n",
    "        )\n",
    "        # ... yield AgentResult\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Flow\n",
    "1. **Planner Input**: Raw user query\n",
    "2. **Solver Input**: Multiagent graph automatically combines:\n",
    "   - Original task\n",
    "   - Planner output (the structured plan)\n",
    "3. **Solver Processing**: Uses plan as guidance while maintaining ReAct flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create the hybrid multiagent graph\n",
    "rewoo_react_graph = create_rewoo_react_graph()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute with user query\n",
    "result = rewoo_react_graph(\n",
    "    \"Hi what time is my flight, my passenger id is '3442 587242'. Change my flight to earlier time.\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access results from each agent\n",
    "planner_result = result.results['planner']  # The structured plan\n",
    "solver_result = result.results['solver']    # Final executed response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid implementation showcases how the Strands multiagent graph framework can combine different agent patterns to create more efficient and reliable workflows that leverage the strengths of both REWOO planning and ReAct execution."
