    "# REWOO-ReAct Hybrid Pattern Airline Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this example we will guide you through how to create a REWOO-ReAct hybrid pattern implementation using Strands Agents multiagent orchestration. We will demonstrate a two-agent system that combines REWOO's structured planning approach with ReAct's direct tool execution, creating an efficient hybrid workflow that balances planning reliability with execution flexibility for airline customer service tasks.\n",

    "## Key Features\n",
    "* **Two-agent hybrid pipeline**: Planner generates structured plans, Solver executes with ReAct flexibility\n",
    "* **Best of both worlds**: REWOO's planning reliability combined with ReAct's execution adaptability\n",
    "* **Reduced latency**: Only 2 agents vs 3 in pure REWOO implementation\n",
    "* **Structured execution**: Plans use #E1, #E2, #E3 format for guided tool execution\n",
    "* **ReAct flexibility**: Solver can adapt execution based on intermediate results and policy constraints\n",
    "* **Better error handling**: ReAct solver can recover from plan deviations and policy violations\n",
    "* **Plan-guided execution**: Maintains systematic approach while allowing execution flexibility\n",
    "* **Airline domain integration**: Complete integration with MAbench airline tools and TauBench datasets\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's implement the **custom agent classes** that extend the base Strands Agents to work with our multiagent graph. We create these custom classes so that each agent can properly integrate with the graph's streaming architecture while maintaining their specialized roles in the hybrid REWOO-ReAct pattern.\n",

    "The `PlannerAgent` class serves as the entry point for our hybrid system, generating structured plans without executing any tools. We implement this with a custom `stream_async` method so that it can seamlessly integrate with the multiagent graph while providing the structured output format required for the ReAct solver.\n",

    "The agent normalizes the input prompt and calls its `generate_flight_plan` tool to create the structured execution plan.

    "The agent uses the `extract_original_task_and_plan` helper function to separate the user's original request from the planner's structured output. It then calls the `solve_flight_query` tool with both components, allowing the ReAct agent to execute the plan while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on intermediate results and policy constraints.\n",

We design it this way so that the hybrid approach maintains the systematic planning benefits of REWOO while enabling the execution flexibility of ReAct.\n",

    "Congratulations! You've successfully created and tested a REWOO-ReAct hybrid pattern implementation using Strands Agents multiagent orchestration. This system demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-agent hybrid architecture** combining REWOO's structured planning with ReAct's execution flexibility for optimal performance\n",
    "- **Plan-guided execution workflow** where structured reasoning (#E1, #E2, #E3 format) guides ReAct tool execution while maintaining adaptability\n",
    "- **Strands  Agents GraphBuilder integration** using custom Agent classes with stream_async() methods for seamless multiagent coordination\n",
    "- **Best-of-both-worlds approach** leveraging REWOO's planning reliability and ReAct's execution flexibility with reduced latency\n",
    "- **Airline domain integration** with comprehensive MAbench tool execution and TauBench evaluation datasets for real-world testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The REWOO-ReAct hybrid pattern excels at complex multi-step tasks requiring both systematic planning and execution adaptability, such as airline customer service scenarios where structured planning ensures comprehensive coverage while ReAct flexibility handles policy constraints, error recovery, and dynamic decision-making during tool execution.\n",
