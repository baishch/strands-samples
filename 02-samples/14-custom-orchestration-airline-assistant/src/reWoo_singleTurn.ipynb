    "In this example we will guide you through how to create a REWOO (Reasoning Without Observation) pattern implementation using Strands multiagent orchestration. We will demonstrate a three-agent system that separates reasoning (planning) from acting (tool execution), enabling more reliable and debuggable agent workflows for airline customer service tasks.\n",

In Strands, this becomes a small, explicit graph where each node returns a typed result (`AgentResult`) and the runtime forwards those results downstream in a deterministic way. This leads to **governance**, **observability**, and **repeatability**.\n",

    "## Helper functions for executor\n",

    "Now let's look at how we execute each individual step in our REWOO plan. The `execute_single_step` function is the workhorse that takes each **#E1, #E2, #E3** step and actually runs the corresponding airline tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Execution Process\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the function **parses the argument string** (like `\"reservation_id=CD789012, cabin=economy\"`) into a proper dictionary that Python can work with. Then it builds context from all previous evidence steps so that later steps can reference earlier results - this is crucial for the REWOO pattern where each step builds on previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most tools, we use our smart `resolve_arguments` function to convert vague parameter values into the exact formats the airline APIs need. But we handle two special cases differently:\n",
    "- The **\"think\" tool** just stores reasoning text\n",
    "- The **\"calculate\" tool** uses an LLM to extract mathematical expressions from the context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Argument Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `resolve_arguments()` defined in `rewoo_helpers.py` to extract the arguments and their values accurately before calling the particular airline tool. The `resolve_arguments` function intelligently converts vague parameter values from the plan into the exact formats required by airline tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "It takes parameter names and their rough values (like *\"New York\"* for origin), then uses an LLM agent to extract the precise format needed (like *\"JFK\"* airport code). The function has built-in knowledge of airline domain requirements:\n",
    "- **Airports** need 3-letter codes\n",
    "- **Dates** need YYYY-MM-DD format  \n",
    "- **Cabin classes** have specific values like \"economy\" or \"business\"\n",
    "- **Complex parameters** like flight lists need proper JSON arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "For each parameter, it creates a specialized prompt that tells the LLM exactly what format to return, then handles type conversion (strings, integers, JSON arrays) to ensure the airline tools receive properly formatted data. This bridges the gap between human-readable plan parameters and the strict data formats that airline APIs require.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we execute the actual airline tool (like getting reservation details or searching flights) and carefully store both successful results and any errors in our evidence dictionary. This evidence becomes the foundation for our Solver agent to create the final user response.\n",

    "## Handle Batch Operations with REPEAT Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's explore how our REWOO system handles batch operations through **REPEAT blocks**. The `handle_repeat_block` function enables us to process multiple items with the same set of operations - like updating several reservations or applying multiple certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function starts by using an LLM to analyze the previous evidence and determine how many items need processing. For example, if a user has 3 reservations that need updating, the LLM examines the evidence from earlier steps and extracts both the count (3) and the list of reservation IDs to process. We need a way for the system to automatically figure out how many times to repeat an operation based on the actual data from previous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `REPEAT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` is a specialized template that helps our LLM analyze JSON responses from earlier evidence steps and determine iteration counts dynamically. For example, when a user says *\"downgrade all my business flights to economy,\"* we first get their user details which contains a list of reservations. This prompt then instructs the LLM to examine that JSON data, count how many reservations exist, and extract the specific reservation IDs to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this prompt in our `handle_repeat_block` function to make REPEAT operations truly dynamic - instead of hardcoding \"repeat 3 times,\" the system intelligently determines \"this user has 3 reservations, so repeat 3 times with these specific IDs.\" This makes our REWOO system capable of handling real-world scenarios where the number of items to process varies by user and situation.\n",

    "Now let's assemble our three REWOO components into a working multiagent system. Since the Strands multiagent graph requires specific communication protocols, we need to create custom agent classes that extend the base `Agent` class with specialized `stream_async` methods.\n",

    "Each agent follows the same pattern: it receives input, calls its specialized tool, then packages the result in the proper `AgentResult` format that the multiagent graph expects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PlannerAgent** uses only the `generate_flight_plan` tool to create structured plans\n",
    "- **WorkerAgent** has access to all the airline domain tools plus the `execute_flight_plan` orchestrator - this gives it everything needed to execute any plan step  \n",
    "- **SolverAgent** uses the `solve_flight_query` tool to synthesize final responses\n",
    "\n",
    "The key technical detail is the `stream_async` method in each agent. This method must:\n",
    "1. Normalize the input prompt\n",
    "2. Call the appropriate tool\n",
    "3. Create a proper `Message` object with the results\n",
    "4. Wrap it in an `AgentResult` with metrics and state information\n",
    "5. Yield it in the format the graph expects\n",

    "This ensures seamless communication between agents as data flows from Planner → Worker → Solver.\n",
